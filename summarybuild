This file is to elaborate building the baremetal like nodes within you virtual environment: 

1- Ubuntu VM (This was done on both 16.4, 18.04). 
2- install kind 
apt update && apt upgrade -y
apt install docker.io -y
apt install -y apt-transport-https
curl -s https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt/doc/apt-key.gpg | sudo apt-key add -
apt update -y
apt install -y kubeadm kubelet kubectl
curl -Lo ./kind https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/dl/v0.7.0/kind-$(uname)-amd64
chmod +x ./kind  
mv ./kind /some-dir-in-your-PATH/kind
mv ./kind /usr/bin/kind

3- create simple yaml file to build the infrastructure for example "kindcluster.yaml"

then use, kind create cluster --config kindcluster.yaml

after nodes are built the output of "kubectl get nodes" should be like that: 
NAME                 STATUS   ROLES    AGE    VERSION
kind-control-plane   Ready    master   156m   v1.17.0
kind-worker          Ready    <none>   156m   v1.17.0
kind-worker2         Ready    <none>   156m   v1.17.0
kind-worker3         Ready    <none>   156m   v1.17.0
kind-worker4         Ready    <none>   156m   v1.17.0

After nodes are in ready state, you can now build the deployment with pods and services: 

Note: I added the port mapping, incase accessing from outside is required, so you can add the port-forward command and use the mentioned
node ports to access the service from external machines. 

[In production]
You can update the base yaml file for building the cluster and include the commands required to integrate search headers, forwarders,
Licensing manager and indexers, so you can have the full deployment without further manual actions. 

kubectl create -f splunkenterprise_dep.yaml
output:
